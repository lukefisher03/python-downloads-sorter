# python-downloads-sorter
Sort your downloads folder using python

This specific program is made to suit my file structure on my computer. So the names of the folders and files are specific to my system. However, the general logic remains constant. If you wish to use it then you will need to remove my file destinations and replace them with your own. And the additionally, you will need to add new instances of the SortType class in order to specify new file types to be sorted.
